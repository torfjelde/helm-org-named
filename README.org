#+TITLE: =helm-org-named=

=helm.el= source for completion of labels found in org-files. In particular labels defined using the =#+name= syntax.

**BE AWARE:** This package is very bare-bones and is something I threw together because I wanted completion for my personal notes. Use with caution.

* Screencasts
** Simple example
We can perform completion both within and across files.

** Real example
Real example of calling =helm-org-named-insert= on my notes. Note how some candidates are empty; this is simply because these blocks have an empty =#+name= entry which I consider a "bug" of my note-taking rather than anything else.

* Installation
If you have [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] set up and =use-package= installed (as per [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#integration-with-use-package][straight.el#integration-with-use-package]]), then it's a simple matter:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package helm-org-named
  :straight (:type git :host github :repo "torfjelde/helm-org-named")
  ;; Optional keyding.
  :bind ("C-c [" . helm-org-named)
  :config
  ;; Inform `helm-org-named' where to search for labels.
  (setq helm-org-named-files '("path/to/file1" "path/to/file2"))
  (setq helm-org-named-directories '("path/to/directory1" "path/to/directory2"))
  ;; If this is `t', then the current file will always be included in the completion.
  (setq helm-org-named-include-current-file t)
  )
#+end_src

Otherwise, the simplest way is to just download the =helm-org-named.el= file and do

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-file "/path/to/helm-org-named.el")
(require 'helm-org-named)

(setq helm-org-named-files '("path/to/file1" "path/to/file2"))
(setq helm-org-named-directories '("path/to/directory1" "path/to/directory2"))

;; Optional keybinding.
(require 'bind-key)
(bind-key "C-c [" #'helm-org-named)
#+end_src
